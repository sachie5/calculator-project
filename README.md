# Calculator Project

My project is to create a calculator using HTML, CSS and Typescript.

## Table of Contents

1. HTML Structure
2. SCSS Structure
3. CSS Grid and Flexbox
4. TypeScript
5.

## HTML Structure

The HTML Structure is made of head tag with links to the scss as well as the different font I added.

The script link is in the body before the main tag.

Themain tag contains a div which is the screen of the calculator and a div that containes the buttons of the calculator - anchor tags within p tags.

## SCSS structure

I have a SCSS for my variables(colours and font) , one for my main (general structure of page) and one for the code for the calculator.

## CSS Grid and Flexbox

The buttons are arranged on the calculator using a CSS grid.

I have utilised flexbox to for the container of the calculator, screen and to center the text within the buttons.

## Typescript


The first section is getting the screen and numberinto variables and adding a p tag into the screen for the text to come.

I used querySelectorAll and .foreach to make the button print the text on the screen when clicked.

For the operations, I stored the element in variables using querySelctor and used .addEventListener to print on the screen using the function.
